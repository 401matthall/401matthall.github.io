First posts are the worst. They're the worst to write. They're the worst to read. They're usually brimming with enthusiasm for the New Year because when else does someone start a blog or write a second First Post. Ugh.

I'm not going to do that to you. I'm not going to do that to me. I want to give informal writing, with an attempt at doing so regularly, a try. I want somewhere to put my thoughts and opinions on things. I want somewhere to exercise my thoughts. That's really what I find writing useful for. Testing, challenging, clarifying my thoughts.

Annnndd we nearly wandered back into the pretentious part of First Posts. That was close. When did we stop adding *two* spaces after closing punctuation in a sentence? I miss that other space.
